# HashGuard - File Integrity Checker

HashGuard is a user-friendly application for verifying the integrity of files by comparing their hash values. It supports multiple hashing algorithms like MD5, SHA-1, and SHA256. With HashGuard, you can ensure that your files remain unaltered and authentic.

## Features

- **File Selection**: Easily select files for hash generation using the graphical interface.
- **Hash Algorithm Support**: Choose from popular hashing algorithms (MD5, SHA-1, SHA256).
- **Hash Generation**: Generate a hash value for the selected file.
- **Reference Hash Comparison**: Enter a reference hash to compare with the generated hash.
- **Real-time Results**: Instantly see whether the hashes match or not.

## User Interface

- **File Selection**: Click the "Select File" button to browse and select the file you want to check.
- **Algorithm Menu**: Choose your preferred hashing algorithm from the dropdown menu.
- **Generate Hash**: Click "Generate Hash" to calculate the hash value for the selected file.
- **Reference Hash Input**: Input the reference hash value in the designated text box.
- **Compare Hashes**: Use the "Compare Hashes" button to verify if the generated hash matches the reference hash.
- **Results Display**: The application will show the comparison result in real-time.

## Supported Hash Algorithms

- **MD5**: Fast but less secure. Suitable for non-critical checks.
- **SHA-1**: More secure than MD5 but vulnerable to certain attacks.
- **SHA256**: Highly secure and recommended for most use cases.

## Use Cases

- Verifying file integrity after downloads.
- Checking for accidental or malicious file modifications.
- Comparing files to ensure consistency across systems.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
